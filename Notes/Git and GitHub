- after going through all of the git to save it to your local repository ^^^^^^^^^see above Git^^^^^^^^^ you can go to GitHub and make a new repository.
- name it and you do not have to check initialize this repo with README
- create repository
- since you've already made a local git repo on your own drive, you can push an existing repo from the command line
    - git remote add origin "https://github.com/you_will_copy_&_paste_this_from_the_site/repoName.git
        - you only have to do this once per project to connect your local repo to the GitHub remote repo.
    -git push -u origin master

-when you make changes to your file and go through git add and git commit on the command line you will then have to git push to add it to GitHub.
