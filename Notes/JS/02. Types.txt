JS TYPES
1. Numbers- in the console you can do simple math, its valid!
    - 12%5 (modulo)- gives you the remainder

2. String- just text! "this is a string, notice the double quotes" (also can you 'single quotes')

    "Hello " + "there!" = "Hello there!"
    but what about: 'this isn't nice'.... will stop at the apostrophe in "isn't", you can use this: 'this isn/'t nice', the backslash means the thing that comes directly after should be ignored.

    10 + "34" = 1034 --- JS assumes that you're trying to add strings together, just a quirk of JS. BUT...
    10 - "3" = 7 --- you can't really substract strings, so it will assume you mean the number. IDEALLY you wouldnt do anything like this.

    if you get NaN means "Not a Number", can't do this: "hello" - "bye" = NaN

3. Boolean- True or False
    3>2 = True
    10<5 = False
    5>=5 = True
    3=3 INVALID, why? wrong syntax: must be 3===3 = True
    3!==3 False... this is saying 3 DOES NOT equal 3

    these are JS Comparisons
        !==
        ===
        >=
        <=
        >
        <

4. Undefined- mean the variable has not been assigned.
    ex. var password;
        undefined, you must enter a password.
