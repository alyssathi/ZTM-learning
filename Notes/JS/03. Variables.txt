VARIABLES: can hold numbers, boolean or string

Instead of writing "These pretzels make me thirsty" + "!" a bunch of times, you can set it equal to variables.

    var p = "These pretzels make me thirsty" + "!"; [enter]
    >>undefined

    p
    "These pretzels make me thirsty!"

Rule: you can't start variables with numbers or symbols (other than _ or $), must start with a letter.

JS standard: camelCase... 
    example: var firstname NO
             var firstName YES

So why do we need to store variables?
ex. Prompt

In the console: 
prompt("what is your username?") ......this will make a prompt in the browser, with a reply option.
The reply will be the output.

    Creating a calculator with prompts and alerts.

        var first = prompt("enter first number");
        var second = prompt("enter second number");
        var sum = Number(first) + Number(second); ......[this changes the string response to a number!]
        alert("The sum is: " + sum);

    why do we need a semicolon? It means that it is the end of an expression.
