Data Structures are like compartment filers. Gives a way to organize your "drawer" of tools.
- different data structures are good for different things

ARRAYS-powerful for to-do lists and categorized things
var listOfAnimals = ["tiger","cat","bear", "bird"];
    console.log(listOfAnimals[1]);
    -- in the console, "cat" will show up. Developers like counting from zero, so tiger(0), cat(1), bear(2), bird(3)
        -this is call 'index' in arrays

- more than just strings can go into an array- numbers, booleans and functions!
    var functionlist = [function apples() {
        console.log("apple");
    }]
-you can also mix your array too! BUT not reccommended lol
- also can make an array within an array
    var list = [
        ["tiger","cat","bear", "bird"]
    ];

    to get "bear" you'd have to use: 
        console.log(list [0][2]);

-arrays are cool because JS has predefined methods for them... think of them as "functions" that are used on arrays

    var listOfAnimals = ["tiger","cat","bear", "bird"];

        your method: list.shift();
        your return in the console: "tiger"
        your new listOfAnimals: ["cat", "bear", "bird"]

        list.pop();
        "bird"
        ["cat", "bear"]

        list.push("elephant");
        3
        >["cat", "bear", "elephant"]

        list.concat(["deer", "moose"]);
        ["cat", "bear", "elephant", "deer", "moose"]
            be careful with these, you have to define a new variable to retrieve this info again because if you ask JS for "list" you will just get: ["cat", "bear", "elephant"].
            must do:
                var newList = list.concat(["deer", "moose"]);
