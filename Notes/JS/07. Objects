- Objects are powerful data structures and are also a javascript type.
- these are collections of properties.

Great for user information!

to write an object:
    var user = {
        name: "John",
        age: 34,
        hobby: "soccer",
        isMarried: false,
    }
        our 'user' is our object. This is different than an array because you can define you 'index'. It is more dynamic in the way you can define properties and values.
            property: value,

How to grab information from objects?
    user.name
    user.age
    user.hobby

How do we add properties to objects like we did with arrays (like pop, shift...)?
    user.favoriteFood = "spinach";
        this will add the property favoriteFood: "spinach",
    
    can change properties like this as well!
    user.isMarried = true;


Using Arrays and Objects together...
    say you have a game where the player controls a wizard. The player information would be great in an object but the spells could easily be put together in an array.
        this means you could put an array in an object!
            var Wizard = {
                name: "Merlin",
                age: 344,
                favoritePotion: "Love Potion",
                spells: ["abrakadabra", "leviOsa", "accio"]
            };
                    to access the leviOsa...
                        user.spells[1];
        but you can also put objects inside arrays
            var Users = [
                {
                    username: "Potter",
                    Password: "GinnyIsCute1"
                },
                {
                    username: "Hermione",
                    password: "smartestpersonever"
                },
                {
                    username: "Malfoy",
                    password: "mugglesSuck"
                }
            ];
                    to access Hermione's password...
                        Users[1].password;

METHOD- a function inside of an object
var Wizard = {
                name: "Merlin",
                age: 344,
                favoritePotion: "Love Potion",
                spells: ["abrakadabra", "leviOsa", "accio"]
                shout: function() {
                    console.log("ahhhhhh!");
                }
            };
                    Can access by Wizard.shout();
                    the function of shout is a method of the Wizard

EMPTY VS NULL OBJECTS
you can have empty arrays or objects
    emptyArray=[]
    var emptyObj={}
        returns undefined
can have null objects
    var nullObj={}
        returns null... means that there is nothing in the object

            you can add names to empty objects but not to null.
