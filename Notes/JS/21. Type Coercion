Type Coercion - all languages do this! These are things to be aware of and shouldn't see too often.

when the operants are different types, one of them will be converted into an equivilent value.
    ex. 
        1 == '1'; JS will convert into -----> 1 == 1; 
    this happens with the double-equal signs (==), it tells JS to compare the two values and if they have different types to try to coerce one into the same type. But we can compare the string to a number using a triple-equal sign (===). This tells JS to compare them explicitly.

    So basically don't us double equal signs.

You can also see these type coercions in if statements
    if (1) {
        console.log(5);
    }
    //will return 5 because JS coerces 1 to equal true.

    if (0) {
        console.log(5);
    }
    //undefined because JS sees 0 as false.
